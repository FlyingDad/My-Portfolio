        <p>I love a challenge! I cannot resist a challenge involving logical thinking, especially computer programming and logic
          puzzles.
        </p>

        <p><strong>My goal is a career change into the iOS Development or Web Development field.</strong></p>

        <p>A quick history:</p>

        <p>My passion for computer programming all started with a Sinclair ZX80 given to me by my father. It hooked up to a
          television, used a version of BASIC and saved data on a cassette recorder. I graduated from the Sinclair and continued
          programming on an Apple II Plus. I have been hooked on programming ever since.</p>

        <p>After high school I wanted to see the world so I enlisted in the U.S. Navy. In the U.S. Navy, I learned computer
          machine language which was used to troubleshoot and repair mainframes. Back then, most computers still had a lot
          of solid state components and we would isolate a faulty computer down to an individual circuit by stepping processor
          instructions through each clock cycle. I also operated and maintained data systems, display systems, analog to
          digital converters, RADARâ€™s, power supplies, and storage media (paper and mag tape).</p>

        <p>After the U.S. Navy, I found I was competing against college graduates for IT jobs. Although I had experience, I
          did not have college training in the newer technology. After 5 months of job seeking, I took a job at BNSF railway.
          It was a chance to experience what almost every boy has dreamed of, working on the railroad. </p>

        <p>While working full time, I took advantage of my VA benefits and earned a BSBA in Information Technology (IT). </p>

        <p>I know the Swift, xCode, iOS, Assembly, C#, and JavaScript programming languages. I'm also fluent in HTML5 and CSS3.
          </p>

        <p>I was also just awarded a Grow With Google Scholarship at Udacity learning Front-End Web Development. I recently
          completed the iOS Developer Nanodegree program at Udacity. I also keep current with the Python programming language
          so I can help my son with his Computer Science courses in college. </p>

        <p><strong>Specialties: iOS Development, Swift, xCode, HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, Express, MongoDB</strong></p>
