        <p>I love a challenge! I cannot resist a challenge involving logical thinking, especially computer programming and logic
          puzzles.</p>

        <p>My passion for computer programming all started with a Sinclair ZX80 given to me by my father. It used a version
          of BASIC and saved data on a cassette recorder. I graduated from the Sinclair and continued programming on an Apple
          II Plus. I have been hooked on programming ever since.</p>

        <p>About me:</p>

        <p> After high school I wanted to see the world so I enlisted in the U.S. Navy. In the U.S. Navy, I learned computer
          machine language which was used to troubleshoot and repair mainframes. Back then, most computers still had a lot
          of solid state components and we would isolate a faulty computer down to an individual circuit by stepping processor
          instructions through each clock cycle. I also operated and maintained data systems, display systems, analog to
          digital converters, RADAR, power supplies, and storage media.</p>

        <p> After the U.S. Navy, I found I was competing against college graduates for IT jobs. Although I had experience, I
          did not have college training the new systems. After 5 months of job seeking, I took a job at BNSF railway. It
          was a chance to experience what almost every kid has dreamed of, working on the railroad.</p>

        <p>While working full time, I took advantage of my VA benefits and earned a BSBA degree with a minor in Information
          Technology (IT).</p>

        <p>I know Swift, xCode, iOS, Assembly, C and C++, and JAVA programming languages. I'm also fluent in HTML5, CSS3, and
          PHP/MySQL.</p>

        <p>I recently completed the Udacity iOS Developer Nanodegree Program. I also keep current with the Python programming
          language so I can help my son with his Computer Science courses in college.</p>

          <strong>Specialties:</strong> iOS Development, Swift, xCode, Front-End Web Development, JavaScript</p>
